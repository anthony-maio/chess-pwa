# chess-pwa

A chess game implemented as a progressive web app for my daughter, powered by the chess.js library.

You can see this application in action and play it for free here on Github - it is hosted on Github pages.

Upon visiting that site, browsers like Chrome and Safari allow you to install the website as a progressive web app - an easier path to distribution that proprietary app stores in this instance - and a way for me to allow my daughter who loves chess to install this on her iPad without me having to cough up dough for an Apple Developer License.

Once installed, the PWA supports fully offline play - no internet or data connection required.
